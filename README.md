# ML/AI Portfolio

Welcome to my ML/AI portfolio! This repository contains various works completed during my studies, covering a range of topics in machine learning and artificial intelligence. Each directory corresponds to a specific area of AI and includes courses, exercises, and projects.

## About Me

I am a student in machine learning (ML) and artificial intelligence (AI) at Miami-Dade College (USA) and Collège de Bois-de-Boulogne (CA). I have been studying in this exciting field for two years now, during which I have acquired a wide and deep range of skills.
