# Chapter 1: Introduction to Supervised Learning

This chapter provides an introduction to supervised learning, defining its approaches and comparing them with unsupervised learning and reinforcement learning. The main objective is to understand the fundamental principles, goals, and examples of algorithms used in these approaches.

## Supervised Learning

*Definition*:
- An algorithm that involves a target/result variable, also known as a dependent variable, which needs to be predicted from a set of predictors or independent variables.
- **Goal**: Generate a function that maps inputs to one or more outputs.
- **Examples of algorithms**: Decision Tree, Naive Bayes, Linear Regression, K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Random Forest.

## Unsupervised Learning

*Definition*:
- An algorithm where there is no target/result variable to be predicted and does not require training.
- **Goal**: Perform clustering or segmentation of data into different groups based on specific criteria.
- **Examples of algorithms**: K-means, Hierarchical Clustering, DBSCAN.

## Reinforcement Learning

*Definition*:
- An algorithm where the machine is exposed to an environment allowing learning through trial and error.
- **Goal**: Enable the machine to make specific decisions.
- **Examples of algorithms**: Markov Decision Process, Q-Learning, Temporal Difference.

## Developing Concepts on Supervised Learning

### Classes

We distinguish between two cases:
- **Regression**: Case of a continuous variable.
- **Classification**: Case of a discrete variable.

### Commonly Used Algorithms

- Linear Regression
- Logistic Regression
- Decision Tree
- Support Vector Machine (SVM)
- Naive Bayes
- K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
- K-Means
- Random Forest

### Definition of Classification

- Given a set of records, considered as a training set:
  - Each record is characterized by a tuple (x, y)
  - x is the attribute, predictor, independent variable, input
  - y is the class label, response, dependent variable, output

**Objective**: Define a model that maps each set of attributes x to one of the predefined class labels.

### Classification Techniques

*Basic Classifiers*:
- Decision Tree based Methods
- Rule-based Methods
- Nearest-Neighbor
- Neural Networks
- Naive Bayes
- Support Vector Machines (SVM)

*Ensemble Classifiers*:
- Boosting
- Bagging
- Random Forests
