# Chapter 4: Advanced Techniques in Supervised Learning

This chapter delves into advanced techniques in supervised learning. We will explore the need for regularization, understand ensemble methods, and implement principal component analysis (PCA) for dimensionality reduction. The following topics will be covered in this chapter:
