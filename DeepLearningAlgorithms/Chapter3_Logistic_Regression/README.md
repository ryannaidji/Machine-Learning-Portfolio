# Chapter 3: Logistic Regression

Logistic regression is a fundamental classification algorithm in machine learning and deep learning. This chapter provides a comprehensive overview of logistic regression, starting with its basic principles and extending to more advanced concepts like softmax regression. Understanding logistic regression is crucial as it forms the foundation for more complex algorithms and models used in deep learning.
