# Chapter 4: Clustering

This chapter explores various clustering algorithms used in unsupervised learning to group data points into meaningful clusters. Clustering techniques are essential for discovering patterns, segmenting data, and identifying similarities within a dataset. The chapter covers centroid-based, connectivity-based, distribution-based, and density-based clustering methods.
