    "## Overview of Association Rules\n",
    "\n",
    "Association rule learning is a popular and well-researched method for discovering interesting relations between variables in large databases. It is commonly used in market basket analysis to identify sets of products that frequently co-occur in transactions.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Concepts in Association Rules\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Itemset**:\n",
    "   - A collection of one or more items.\n",
    "   - Example: `{milk, bread, butter}`.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Support**:\n",
    "   - The support of an itemset is the proportion of transactions in the dataset in which the itemset appears.\n",
    "   - Formula: `Support(X) = (Number of transactions containing X) / (Total number of transactions)`.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Confidence**:\n",
    "   - Confidence is the likelihood that an item Y is purchased when item X is purchased.\n",
    "   - Formula: `Confidence(X → Y) = Support(X ∪ Y) / Support(X)`.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Lift**:\n",
    "   - Lift is the ratio of the observed support to that expected if X and Y were independent.\n",
    "   - Formula: `Lift(X → Y) = Confidence(X → Y) / Support(Y)`.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Association Rule**:\n",
    "   - An implication expression of the form X → Y, where X and Y are disjoint itemsets.\n",
    "   - Example: `{milk, bread} → {butter}`.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Applications of Association Rules\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Market Basket Analysis**:\n",
    "   - Identifies products frequently bought together.\n",
    "   - Example: Customers who buy bread and butter are likely to buy milk.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Inventory Management**:\n",
    "   - Helps in managing stock by understanding product associations.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Recommendation Systems**:\n",
    "   - Provides product recommendations based on item co-occurrence.\n",
    "   - Example: Online stores recommending products based on past purchases.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Fraud Detection**:\n",
    "   - Detects patterns that indicate fraudulent behavior.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example of Association Rule Learning\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's implement a basic example of association rule learning using the `apriori` algorithm from the `mlxtend` library in Python.\n"
