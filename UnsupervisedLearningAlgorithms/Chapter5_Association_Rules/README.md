# Chapter 5: Association Rule Learning

Association Rule Learning is a rule-based machine learning method for discovering interesting relations between variables in large datasets. It is commonly used in market basket analysis, where it helps to identify sets of products that frequently co-occur in transactions. This chapter covers the fundamental concepts and algorithms for association rule learning, including the Apriori and FP-Growth algorithms.
