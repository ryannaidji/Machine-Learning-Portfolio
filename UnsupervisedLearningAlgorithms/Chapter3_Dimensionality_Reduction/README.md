# Chapter 3: Dimensionality Reduction

This chapter delves into the various techniques used for reducing the dimensionality of datasets. Dimensionality reduction is essential for simplifying models, reducing computation time, and eliminating noise from data. The three main techniques we will explore are Principal Component Analysis (PCA), Multiple Correspondence Analysis (MCA), and Factor Analysis of Mixed Data (FAMD).
