# 3. Steps of an AI Project

## 1. Analysis

In the analysis phase, we conduct a needs assessment. This involves consulting with domain experts, application specialists whose knowledge is essential for developing a relevant solution, software architects, developers, AI specialists, governance actors (such as legal representatives for data management and access to private data, company representatives to define economic and ecological objectives, etc.), and a cybersecurity expert.

## 2. Data Collection

Data is the "black gold" of an AI project. Without data, it is impossible to ensure the success of an AI project. The objective is to collect as much data as possible, even if we are not sure if it will be used later. Data can be obtained from mobile applications, sensors, observations, etc.

## 3. Exploratory Data Analysis

We conduct an exploratory data analysis to better understand our raw data. This is done through visualizations, listing our variables, obtaining the dimensions of our data, etc.

## 4. Data Preprocessing

During data preprocessing, we perform several steps, including managing missing data, handling outliers, and other data manipulations and transformations.

## 5. Post-Data Analysis

We perform a post-data analysis to better understand our data after preprocessing.

## 6. Modeling

Based on the data and the decision requirements of our AI project, this is where we develop our various algorithms (models).

## 7. Testing, Evaluation, and Validation of Models

Next, we need to test our models and evaluate their robustness, confirming their relevance. We evaluate our models using different metrics depending on the type of learning used.

## 8. Production Deployment and Monitoring

Once our models are validated, they are ready for production deployment. However, it is essential to monitor the performance of our models to ensure they do not become obsolete.

Note: Sometimes, we may need to repeat certain steps, such as exploratory data analysis and data processing, to achieve better model performance.

There is also a step after data processing called Features Engineering, where we manually select relevant and useful "predictor" variables and assign weights to them for our models.
