# 2. Artificial Intelligence VS Machine Learning VS Deep Learning

This section explains the differences between Artificial Intelligence (AI), Machine Learning (ML), and Deep Learning (DL).

## Artificial Intelligence (AI)

**Artificial Intelligence (AI)** refers to the simulation of human intelligence processes by machines, especially computer systems. These processes include:

- **Learning**: The acquisition of information and rules for using that information.
- **Reasoning**: Using rules to reach approximate or definite conclusions.
- **Self-correction**: The ability to adapt and improve over time based on past experiences.

AI is a broad field that encompasses many different technologies and applications.

## Machine Learning (ML)

**Machine Learning (ML)** is a subset of AI that focuses on the development of algorithms that allow computers to learn from data and make predictions or decisions based on that data.

### Key Characteristics of ML

- **Data-Driven**: Relies on large datasets to train models.
- **Adaptive**: Improves performance over time based on available data.
- **Predictive**: Capable of making predictions or decisions based on patterns found in the data.

### Types of Machine Learning

- **Supervised Learning**: The algorithm is trained on labeled data (input-output pairs).
- **Unsupervised Learning**: The algorithm is used on unlabeled data and must find patterns and relationships.
- **Reinforcement Learning**: The algorithm learns by interacting with an environment to achieve a goal, receiving feedback in the form of rewards or penalties.

## Deep Learning (DL)

**Deep Learning (DL)** is a specialized subset of machine learning that uses artificial neural networks with many layers (hence "deep") to analyze various types of data.

### Key Characteristics of DL

- **Neural Networks**: Utilizes artificial neural networks with multiple layers (deep networks).
- **High Performance**: Capable of handling and analyzing large amounts of data, leading to superior performance on complex tasks.
- **Feature Learning**: Automatically discovers the representations needed for feature detection or classification from raw data.

### Applications of Deep Learning

- **Image Recognition**: Identifying objects, people, and scenes in images.
- **Speech Recognition**: Converting spoken language into text.
- **Natural Language Processing**: Understanding and generating human language.
- **Autonomous Vehicles**: Enabling self-driving cars to recognize and respond to their environment.
