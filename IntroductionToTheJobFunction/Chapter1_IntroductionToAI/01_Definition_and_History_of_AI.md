> **Artificial Intelligence (AI)**, a set of theories and techniques implemented to create machines capable of simulating human intelligence. It aims to reproduce multiple facets of human intelligence, such as understanding language, recognizing patterns, solving problems, and the ability to learn.

## My Definition
**Artificial Intelligence (AI)** refers to the ability of a computing agent or any other computer program to observe, understand, interact, and make decisions.

# 1.2 History of AI

## Key Milestones in the History of AI

### 1936
- **Turing Machine**: Evaluation of the capability of a machine to have a human-like conversation by Alan Turing.
  - Alan Turing, a pioneer in computing, proposed a test to qualify a machine or computer as "intelligent."
  - This test involves a human engaging in a blind verbal confrontation with a computer and another human. If the person conducting the conversations cannot distinguish which interlocutor is the computer, then the computer's software is considered to have successfully passed the test and can be deemed intelligent.

### 1956
- **Artificial Intelligence**: John McCarthy coins the term "artificial intelligence" at the Dartmouth Conference.
  - The term "Artificial Intelligence (AI)" is officially used during the Dartmouth Conference by Minsky, McCarthy, Newell, and Shannon.
  - This conference is widely considered the founding moment of AI as an independent theoretical discipline separate from computer science.

### 1975
- **AI Winter**: A period marked by reduced funding and interest in AI research due to unmet expectations and technical limitations.
  - The first AI winter occurred in 1973, with the intervention of English mathematician Sir James Lighthill on the BBC, expressing doubts about AI.
  - Researchers in this field faced budget cuts, limiting their research capabilities.
  - This winter, which ended in the early 1980s, represents one of the darkest periods for AI development.

### 1997
- **AI vs. Chess**: IBM's Deep Blue defeats Garry Kasparov, the world chess champion, marking a significant achievement in AI.
  - The Deep Blue vs. Kasparov matches were two six-game chess matches between Russian world champion Garry Kasparov and an American IBM supercomputer called Deep Blue.
  - In 1996, the machine won the first game, but Kasparov secured three victories.
  - The 1996 Deep Blue was nearly two meters tall and weighed 700 kg.
  - The second confrontation took place in New York in May 1997 and was won by Deep Blue.

### 2010
- **Rapid Evolution**: Early developments in deep learning lead to significant advancements in AI capabilities.
  - At the beginning of this decade, AI was illustrated by IBM's Watson's remarkable advancements.
  - We experienced a new boom thanks to massive data and new computing power.

### 2014
- **AI vs. Go**: Google's AlphaGo defeats the world's best Go players, showcasing the power of AI in complex strategic games.
  - On July 18, 2016, AlphaGo became the world's top Go player according to the GoRatings rankings.
  - AlphaGo is a computer program capable of playing the game of Go, developed by the British company DeepMind, which was acquired by Google in 2014.

### 2018
- **AI vs. Video Games**: DeepMind's AlphaStar wins 10 matches in StarCraft II, demonstrating advanced AI strategies in real-time strategy games.
  - In 2018, AlphaStar, Google's DeepMind AI, defeated professional players in StarCraft II.

### Additional Important Dates in AI History

### 1943
- **First AI Concept**: Warren McCulloch and Walter Pitts propose a model of artificial neurons, laying the groundwork for neural networks.

### 1950
- **Turing Test**: Alan Turing introduces the Turing Test as a measure of machine intelligence.

### 1965
- **ELIZA**: Joseph Weizenbaum develops ELIZA, an early natural language processing computer program.

### 1980
- **Expert Systems**: The development and commercialization of expert systems, such as XCON, which assist with complex decision-making.

### 2006
- **Deep Learning Emergence**: Geoffrey Hinton and his team popularize deep learning, leading to a resurgence in AI research.

### 2011
- **AI in Jeopardy!**: IBM's Watson competes on Jeopardy! and defeats two of the game show's greatest champions.

### 2012
- **ImageNet Breakthrough**: A deep learning algorithm developed by Geoffrey Hinton's team wins the ImageNet competition, significantly improving image recognition technology.

### 2016
- **Self-Driving Cars**: Major advancements in autonomous vehicle technology, with companies like Tesla and Google making significant strides.

### 2020
