    "\n",
    "Structured data is a type of data organized in a specific manner and follows a predefined schema. Key characteristics include:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Predefined Format**: Usually stored in tables, relational databases, or CSV files.\n",
    "- **Defined Schema**: Follow a predefined data model. For example, relational databases with tables and specific columns and data types.\n",
    "- **Ease of Analysis**: Due to their consistent organization, structured data is easier to analyze, query, and extract meaningful information.\n",
    "\n",
    "Examples include financial data, inventory tracking data, sales data, demographic data, billing data, and structured weather data.\n",

    "### Unstructured Data\n",
    "\n",
    "Unstructured data does not follow a predefined organization or schema. Characteristics include:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Lack of Structure**: Includes free text, media (images, videos, audio files), PDF documents, emails, web pages, social media posts, raw sensor data, etc.\n",
    "- **Variety**: Comes in many different forms, making analysis complex.\n",
    "- **Difficulty of Analysis**: Requires advanced analysis techniques such as natural language processing (NLP), computer vision, speech recognition, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "Examples include social media posts, customer comments, YouTube videos, Instagram images, emails, audio recordings, conversation transcripts, unformatted reports, blogs, social media monitoring data, etc.\n",
